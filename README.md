1.	INTRODUCTION:

The space is an AR Game built using unity’s game engine. The game is primarily built for android devices using unity’s integration of AR Core, Google’s AR development kit for android devices. This is a simple AR project that shows the difference in scale between Earth and Saturn and provides an immersive experience by mending them into our reality using AR.

2.	IMPLEMENTATION:

Using Unity’s capabilities and the information available online these celestial bodies could be deferred and crafted to scale and detail. AR Core, Google’s AR development kit acts as a bridge between the virtual and real worlds. Through AR Core’s motion tracking and Raycasting features the android device is able to perceive its surroundings within the users physical space. The entire experience relies on the device’s ability to recognize one’s physical environment. Using AR Core’s mapping features it is ensured that the virtual responds naturally to the physical world. Utilizing device movements users can manipulate celestial bodies. Ar Core’s compatibility with android devices helps in optimizing performance on a wide range of hardware.

3.	USER GUIDE:

3.1.	Permissions:
Camera module

3.2.	Requirements :
Android 7.0 ‘Nougat’ (API Level 24) or higher.
Google play services for AR to build the app in development.

Head over to File -> build settings -> android -> Build. The required configurations to build the app in development has already been set. When the app is installed it’ll be under the name Space. On launching the game you will be greeted with a splash screen from unity and then will be requested to provide permission to use your camera. On granting, the app will run successfully displaying the models of Earth and Saturn and on pointing the camera to flat horizontal surface, a dust layer will be displays to show the affects of lighting and raycasting. To close the app simply end the application





4.	FUTURE WORK:

This app is a barebone version and can have many improvements to enhance the experience and utilize all aspects of augmented reality.
 A few of them maybe :
improved shaders - Improving shaders will allow the game to take advantage of all of the model hardware and display a much more realistic version with minimal performance drop.
 Adding information – The game could be made more interactive by adding slight bits and parts of information about objects placed on screen.
Scale and rotation – allowing users directly interact with these objects on screen will provide a much more immersive experience
